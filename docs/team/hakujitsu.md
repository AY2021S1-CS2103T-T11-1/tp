 ## Project: StonksBook

 StonksBook is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
 If you can type fast, StonksBook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

 * **New Feature**: Sales Feature

 ### Enhancements implemented:
 
 New Feature: Sales
 * What it does: allows the user to manage sales within the application. The following functionalities are implemented:
     * Creation of Sale model and storage.
     * List, add, edit and delete commands for sales objects.
     * Mass commands for addition, editing and deletion of sales, that can take in multiple sales as parameters and add/edit/delete them.
     * Viewing a breakdown of the number of sales belonging to each of the top 5 tags.
     * A GUI that contains the list of sales.
 * Justification: This feature is crucial in StonksBook as creating and managing sales is a core functionality of the application, 
 and forms the foundation of the sales analytics features.
 * Highlights: 
 This enhancement was a very large and challenging feature to implement.
 It affected commands to be added in future, namely the command to view sales statistics. 
 It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, as the relationship between Person and Sale needed to be considered carefully.
 A summary of the analysis can be viewed here: "".
 
 New Feature: Ad Hoc Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 * What it does: switches the object list displayed in the component. 
  * Justification: allows for the user to store information that does not correspond to any particular person field.
  For example, they can use it to take note of the client's needs, wants and preferences.
  * Highlights: This was a relatively simple feature to implement.
 
 Enhancement: Addition of Remark field to Person class
 * What it does: allows the user to add miscellaneous remarks to contacts in the address book. 
 * Justification: allows for the user to store information that does not correspond to any particular person field.
 For example, they can use it to take note of the client's needs, wants and preferences.
 * Highlights: This was a relatively simple feature to implement.
